OnClick_NewGame() Logic:
The System_DataPersistenceManager.NewGame() = Make a new Game Data File.
The Additive Load and Unload scene will trigger the OnSceneLoad & OnSceneUnload which = READ the newly initialized Game Data file.
(!) This will work fine for MainMenu system. But in the case of gameplay saving, might need some tweaks.

OnClicl_ContinueGame() Logic:
Has similar function as OnClick_NewGame, but this just reading initialized Game Data file.
